\begin{abstract}
We design and implement Mars, a MapReduce runtime system accelerated with
graphics processing units (GPUs). MapReduce is a simple and flexible
parallel programming paradigm originally proposed by Google, for the ease
of large scale data processing on thousands of CPUs. Compared
with CPUs, GPUs have an order of magnitude higher computation power
and memory bandwidth. However, GPUs are designed as special-purpose
co-processors and their programming interfaces are less familiar than
those on the CPUs to MapReduce programmers.
 
To harness GPUs' power for MapReduce, we developed
Mars to run on NVIDIA GPUs, AMD GPUs, as well as
multi-core CPUs.  Furthermore, we integrated Mars into Hadoop,
an open-source CPU-based distributed MapReduce system. Mars hides the
programming complexity of GPUs behind the simple and familiar
MapReduce interface, and automatically manages task partitioning,
data distribution, and parallelization on the processors.
We have implemented six representative applications on Mars
and evaluated their performance on PCs equipped with GPUs
as well as multi-core CPUs. The GPU acceleration with an NVIDIA GTX280 achieved a speedup of an order of magnitude over a quad-core CPU. Utilizing both the GPU and the CPU further improved GPU-only performance by 40\% for some applications. Additionally, integrating Mars into Hadoop
enabled GPU acceleration for a network of PCs.
