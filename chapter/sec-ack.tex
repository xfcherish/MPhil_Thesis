I would never have completed this work without the help from many people. First of all, I thank my advisor, Professor Qiong Luo, for her years of mentoring, advice, and encouragement. I have learned from her how to develop, evaluate, express, and defend my ideas. These skills are important for my later PhD study. 

I thank the members of my thesis committee, Professor S.C. Cheung and Professor Lin Gu, for their insightful comments on improving this work. 

I thank my colleagues in HKUST -- Dr. Bingsheng He, Dr. Xiangye Xiao, Mr. Yinan Li, Mr. Mian Lu, Mr. Robin Jun Yang, Mr. Ken Lau, Dr. Ke Yang and many others. We have finished several deadlines as a team. In daily life, we have been good friends. Without them, my graduate study in HKUST would not be so colorful. 

Last but not least, I thank my parents and my wife, for their support and encouragement.
